## Usage

wkhtmltopdf binary will be extracted to the `/opt/bin`.

wkhtmltopdf can be executed directly as a command line binary, or via a wrapper.

Refer to `/tests` directory for example usage.

## Build, Test, Publish

Refer to the following scripts to build and publish your own wkhtmltopdf layer.

1. Run `./build.sh` to build a new layer zip.
2. Run `./test.sh` to test the layer zip.
3. Run `./publish.sh` to publish the layer zip to regions specified in `/config/regions.txt`.
